# Hotkey practice

This is a hotkey practice tool I made to practice PvP strats like rocket macing
Left panel has keybinds to each slot in-game
The right panel has the sequence you want to practice.
I.e. rocket macing needs this sequence of actions
```
> switch to elytra slot
> take off elytra
> switch to emace
> hit with mace
> switch to elytra
> put on elytra
> spacebar for flying mode
> switch to rocket
> use rocket
```
And all would need to be done in the space of <0.5s so the tool keeps track of how long each action took.
