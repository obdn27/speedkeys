# Hotkey practice

This is a hotkey practice tool I made to practice PvP strats like rocket macing
Left panel has keybinds to each slot in-game
The right panel has the sequence you want to practice.
This sequence is configurable to what you need to do, be it elytra macing, attribute swapping, shield stunning.

I.e. rocket stun slam needs this sequence of actions
```
> switch to elytra slot
> take off elytra
> switch to axe
> disable shield with axe
> switch to mace
> hit with mace
> switch to elytra
> put on elytra
> spacebar for flying mode
> switch to rocket
> use rocket
```

And all would need to be done in the space of <0.5s so the tool keeps track of how long the total sequence took.
It also shows you how long between each successive action, which is useful to watch as for certain actions you might need to target <50ms
